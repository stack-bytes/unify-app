## Why MongoDB? 🍃

We rolled with MongoDB for our database needs because it's like the superhero of databases - flexible, scalable, and ready for anything. With its JSON-like documents, we can store and retrieve data lightning fast, giving you a seamless experience.

## Why Express.js? 🚂

Express.js powers our backend, and we love it for its simplicity and speed. It's like the reliable engine on a train, ensuring our app runs smoothly and efficiently. With Express.js, handling requests is a breeze, and building robust APIs is just plain fun.

## Why React Native? ⚛️

When it comes to the frontend, React Native steals the show. It's like having a magic wand for crafting beautiful, native mobile apps. With a single codebase, we can reach both iOS and Android users, making your Unify App experience consistent and delightful, no matter your device.

## Why Node.js? 🚀

Our backend runs on Node.js, the rockstar of server-side JavaScript. It's lightning-fast, non-blocking, and event-driven, just what we need to keep things moving. With Node.js, we're serving up data to your Unify App faster than you can say "community vibes."

## Why Native Wind for styling? 💨

For the frontend's style game, we picked Native Wind. It's like having a stylish wardrobe for our React Native components. With utility-first classes and a breeze of customization, we keep things looking fresh and on-brand without breaking a sweat.
